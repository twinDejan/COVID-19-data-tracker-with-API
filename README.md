# COVID-19-data-tracker-with-API
My COVID-19 tracker is a simple data display for the country that you want.
I design it with HTML and CSS, then I used JavaScript to fetch the datas from API.
This is free to use API: https://corona.lmao.ninja/v2/countries/:country

You can use this api in other javascript framework or library and can make it more advanced :)
